Description:
 upstream ships an out of date version of libtool.  this ensures that
 we build against an up-to-date version of libtool by running libtoolize
 as part of our build process (this is called indirectly via ./buildconf.sh
 from debian/rules)
 .
 note that we don't touch the libtool.m4 that they ship here, and this file
 gets included in the build process as part of the phpize stuff.  however,
 this is solved in ./debian/rules where it's overwritten with a symlink.
