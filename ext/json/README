JSON
==========


This extension implements the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
data-interchange format as specified in RFC 7159

The parser is implemented using re2c and Bison. The used versions
of both tools for generating files in the repository are following:

re2c 0.16
Bison 3.0.4

It is recommended to do all contributions to the JSON extension
through the Github Pull Requests and preferably ping @bukka
who maintains the extension.
